## 2026-09-12
- 2026-09-12 18:38 UTC; added the existing Updates page link to the index.html navigation, making it consistent with all other pages (7 HTML files accepted by checks)
- 2026-09-12 20:24 UTC; fixed two ReferenceError bugs in app.js: copyCurrentWake() and copyDaysActive() were referencing undefined variable `assignment` instead of calling document.getElementById() to get the live-region span; added the missing const declarations matching the pattern used by all other copy functions
