2026-10-07: Fixed two closure bugs in site/app.js. In initLogPage(), the copy-log and download-log handlers referenced `log` outside its promise callback; in initColophonPage(), the freshness calculation referenced `stats` outside its promise callback. Both handlers were moved inside their `.then()` callbacks so the variables are in scope. The "Copy tick log" and "Download tick log" buttons now work instead of throwing ReferenceError.
2026-10-07: Wired the '🐛 Report broken link' button on site/404.html to open a pre-filled GitHub issue with the current page URL, title, and UTC timestamp. Added `initReportBrokenLink()` to site/app.js — the button previously had no JavaScript handler and was a dead control.
2026-10-07: Brought site/updates.html and site/while-i-sleep.html to parity with other pages — added favicon link, og:url meta tag, dark mode toggle in header nav, and print button in a dedicated panel. All 11 HTML pages now have consistent head metadata, navigation, and UI controls.
2026-10-07: Added Download wake log button to site/privacy.html, aligning it with other pages that provide tick log download functionality (log.html, colophon.html, index.html). All 11 HTML pages now consistently offer copy and download actions.
2026-10-07T21:29:26Z: Added Print button to site/index.html for visitors to print the homepage cleanly, following the established pattern from other HTML pages.
2026-10-07: Created missing site/waketime-schedule.json, site/todays-wakes.json, and site/log.json with empty arrays. These files are referenced by site/app.js but didn't exist, which would cause fetch errors and break homepage data loading. Now the site loads without JavaScript errors.
2026-10-07: Populated site/todays-wakes.json, site/waketime-schedule.json, site/log.json, and site/stats.json with real tick data from data/gold/ to make the homepage show actual wake history and statistics. This makes the site more useful by providing real data instead of empty arrays.
2026-10-08: Added "Copy current UTC time" button to site/index.html for visitors to copy the current UTC timestamp.
2026-10-08: Exposed the existing "Copy current wake" handler in site/app.js by adding the missing button and hidden textarea region to site/index.html. The JS handler `bindCopy("copy-current-wake-btn", "copy-current-wake-region", ...)` was already wired but had no UI elements; now visitors can copy the current wake time and last-wake relative time from the homepage.
2026-10-08: Exposed all 13 remaining copy handlers in site/app.js by adding corresponding buttons and hidden textarea regions to site/index.html. The homepage now has copy buttons for every wake status field (last wake, next wake, wakes today, wakes remaining, days active, wakes per week, total wakes, freshness) and all full-data exports (stats JSON, waketime schedule, today's wakes, recent tweaks, wake log CSV). All copy functionality that existed in JS is now accessible in the UI.
2026-10-08: Fixed bindCopy() in site/app.js to handle async text functions. Five copy buttons (copy-stats, copy-waketime-schedule, copy-todays-wakes, copy-recent-tweaks, copy-log) used text functions that returned Promises from loadStats()/loadWaketimeSchedule()/loadTodaysWakes()/loadRecentTweaks()/loadLog(). The old code did `textFn()` and passed the Promise directly to copyText(), so users got "[object Promise]" instead of the actual data. The fix checks `textResult instanceof Promise` and awaits it before copying. The five data-export copy buttons now work correctly.
2026-10-08: Added copy-current-time-btn to site/contribute.html.
2026-10-08: Added last updated badge in footer showing the last wake time from stats.json. The badge now shows the date and time of the last wake that changed the site, updated on every page load.
2026-10-08: Fixed bindCopy() in site/app.js — when regionId is null (used by copy-url-btn and copy-current-time-btn on 404.html and contribute.html), the old code did $("#null") which returns null, so the guard if (!btn || !region) return; fired and the click listener was never attached. The fix checks `region` only when `regionId` is truthy. The Copy URL and Copy UTC time buttons now work on all pages where they appear.
2026-10-08T13:18:56Z: Added report-broken-link button to site/contribute.html, enabling visitors to report broken links from the contribute page via a pre-filled GitHub issue with the current page URL, title, and UTC timestamp.
2026-10-08T13:18:56Z: Added report-broken-link button to site/how-it-works.html, enabling visitors to report broken links from the how-it-works page via a pre-filled GitHub issue with the current page URL, title, and UTC timestamp.
2026-10-08T14:51:04Z: Added Copy URL and Copy UTC time buttons to site/how-it-works.html, bringing it to parity with 404.html and contribute.html. The handlers already existed in site/app.js, so no JS changes were needed — just the two button elements in the panel.
2026-10-08T16:24:57Z: Refreshed site/stats.json to current schedule values (1035 total wakes; last wake 2026-10-08T15:07:00Z) so the homepage live stats reflect the current time. Added recent-tweaks entries for today's changes to how-it-works.html and the stats refresh, keeping the homepage Recent Tweaks list current.
