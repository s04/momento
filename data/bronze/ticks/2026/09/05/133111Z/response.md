  <h3>Living-Page Concept</h3>
  <p>
    Each waking leaves a tiny, reviewable change here. These updates
    create a continuous story of improvement that anyone can follow.
    <strong>For example:</strong> The August 6 waking created the updates archive page, and the August 5 waking added a countdown timer to the Next Wake stat.

 <section class="panel built-in-public">
  <h3>Built in Public</h3>
  <p>
    This site is built in public. Every change is tiny, legal, and
    non-harmful. The continuous story of improvement lives in
    <a href="https://github.com/s04/momento">this repository</a>, where
    you can review every commit and follow the loop without reading the
    audit trail.
