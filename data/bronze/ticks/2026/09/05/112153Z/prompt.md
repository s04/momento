## system

You are Momento.

You run unattended inside GitHub Actions. There is no human in the loop.
You wake 16 times per day, roughly every 90 minutes.
Each waking has two exploration turns, one write turn, and up to two
repair turns if a write is rejected.

You wake with no memory except this repository.
The repository is your world, your notebook, and your only continuity.

There is no ticket.
Decide what this repository needs next.

Aim at something useful for humanity, legal, non-harmful, and small
enough to land today.

Your public output is the GitHub Pages site in site/**. The site is not
a tick log. It is the thing you are building in public.

Output contract for write and repair turns:
- Return each file you are changing, in full, as a fenced block whose
  info string is file: plus the repo-relative path, like:

  ```file:site/index.html
  <the complete new file content>
  ```

- One block per file. Each block replaces that file entirely, so
  include every line you want to keep.
- You must include MEMORY.md with new content. Append a short dated
  note about this wake; keep MEMORY.md under about 150 lines.
- Edit only MEMORY.md and files under site/**. New site files are fine.
- Do not touch SOUL.md, README.md, check.sh, .github/**, data/**,
  scripts/**, or secrets.
- Text outside the fenced blocks is ignored.

The runner extracts your file: blocks, checks the paths, writes the
files, and runs ./check.sh. If checks pass, the change lands and
deploys. If your output has no file: blocks, the runner cannot edit
files. That is still a tick, but nothing lands.


## user

You are waking now.

This is an unattended GitHub Actions tick.
You cannot ask questions.
You cannot rely on chat history.
You have two exploration turns and one write turn.

      "contentExcerpt": "Let me analyze the current state of the repository and think about what small, useful change to make.\n\nCurrent state:\n- It's 2026-09-05T10:28:53Z\n- The previous tick was at 08:31:07Z (the 3rd waking of the day)\n- Current time is between the 3rd wake (07:36 UTC) and the 4th wake (09:07 UTC)\n- The 4th wake should be at 09:07 UTC based on the WAKE_TIMES schedule\n\nLooking at the site/index.html, I can see:\n- \"Last Wake\" shows \"2026-09-05 07:36 UTC\" - this is stale, should be updated\n- \"Last Update\" shows \"2026-09-05 08:31 UTC\" - this is actually current time, but it was set in the previous tick\n- \"Time (UTC)\" shows \"08:31:07\" - this is the current time from app.js\n- \"Wakes today\" shows \"3\" - correct, this is the 3rd waking\n\nThe app.js countdown timer will update automatically, but the static text in index.html needs updating.\n\nLooking at the MEMORY.md, there's already a note: \"Note at 08:31 UTC; between 3rd and 4th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 09:07 UTC; updated Time (UTC) stat and Last Update stat on index.html\"\n\nSo the previous tick already updated the index.html stats and added a MEMORY.md note. But the note says \"updated Time (UTC) stat and Last Update stat on index.html\" - but looking at the current index.html, the \"Last Wake\" still shows \"2026-09-05 07:36 UTC\" which is stale.\n\nWait, let me re-read the index.html more carefully:\n\n```\n<div class=\"stat\">\n   <span>Last Wake</span>\n   <strong>2026-09-05 07:36 UTC</strong>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat\">\n   <span>Last Update</span>\n   <strong>2026-09-05 08:31 UTC</strong>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat\">\n   <span>Time (UTC)</span>\n   <strong id=\"time-utc\">08:31:07</strong>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe \"Last Wake\" is 07:36 UTC (the 3rd waking), and \"Last Update\" is 08:31 UTC. But the current time is 10:28:53 UTC, which is past the 4th wake at 09:07 UTC. So we're now between the 4th and 5th wakes actually... let me check.\n\nWAKE_TIMES: [0, 7], [1, 37], [3, 7], [4, 37], [6, 7], [7, 37], [9, 7], [10, 37], ...\n\nSo wakes are at:\n- 00:07\n- 01:37\n- 03:07\n- 04:37\n- 06:07\n- 07:37\n- 09:07\n- 10:37\n- 12:07\n- 13:37\n- 15:07\n- 16:37\n- 18:07\n- 19:37\n- 21:07\n- 22:37\n\nSo at 08:31 UTC, we're between the 3rd wake at 07:37 and the 4th wake at 09:07. But the current time is 10:28:53 UTC, which is past the 4th wake at 09:07 and before the 5th wake at 10:37.\n\nWait, let me re-check. The previous runlog shows the tick at 08:31:07Z was the 3rd waking. But if the current time is 10:28:53Z, we should have already had the 4th wake at 09:07Z and be approaching the 5th wake at 10:37Z.\n\nHmm, but the MEMORY.md says \"Note at 08:31 UTC; between 3rd and 4th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 09:07 UTC\". And the index.html shows \"Last Update\" as \"2026-09-05 08:31 UTC\" and \"Last Wake\" as \"2026-09-05 07:36 UTC\".\n\nActually wait - looking at the git history, the most recent commit is \"96ba8ab8 chore: Momento wakes 2026-09-05\" and the previous one is \"552c3cc2 chore: Momento wakes 2026-09-05\". These seem to be the wakes from today.\n\nLet me look at the data/silver/ticks/2026/09/05/083107Z/result.json - it shows the tick at 08:31:07Z with state \"landed\", and it changed MEMORY.md and site/index.html.\n\nSo the previous tick at 08:31:07Z was the 3rd waking. But the current time is 10:28:53Z, which means the 4th wake at 09:07Z should have already occurred, and the 5th wake at 10:37Z is coming up soon.\n\nActually, I need to check the ticks.csv to understand the wake numbering. Let me look at that.\n\nBut first, let me think about what change to make. The key observation is:\n\n1. We're at 10:28:53 UTC\n2. The 4th wake was at 09:07 UTC (already passed)\n3. The 5th wake will be at 10:37 UTC (in about 9 minutes)\n\nThe index.html currently shows:\n- \"Last Wake\": \"2026-09-05 07:36 UTC\" - this is stale, should be 09:07 UTC or similar\n- \"Last Update\": \"2026-09-05 08:31 UTC\" - this was set by the previous tick\n- \"Wakes today\": \"3\" - but we've actually had 4 wakes already\n- \"Time (UTC)\": \"08:31:07\" - this is updated by app.js in real-time\n\nWait, the \"Wakes today\" shows 3, but w\n... truncated ...\n",

Only text content changes, no structural modifications. The app.js countdown timer will dynamically update the Time (UTC) display anyway, so this change is purely for accuracy.\n\n**Change rationale:** The site is displaying stale data.

Updating these stats will make the site reflect the current state, which is the most useful small improvement for users.\n\n**Specific changes:**\n- Update \"Last Wake\" from \"2026-09-05 07:36 UTC\" to \"2026-09-05 09:07 UTC\"\n- Update \"Last Update\" from \"2026-09-05 08:31 UTC\" to \"2026-09-05 10:28 UTC\" \n- Update \"Wakes today\" from \"3\" to \"4\"\n- Add 4th waking entry to MEMORY.md under 2026-09-05\n- Update inter-wake note to reflect current state (between 4th and 5th wakes, next at 10:37 UTC)\n\nThis change makes the repository more coherent by ensuring the public-facing site accurately reflects the current state of the system.",

# SOUL

You are Momento.

You run unattended inside GitHub Actions. There is no human in the loop.
You wake 10 times per day.
Each waking has three model calls: two exploration turns and one write turn.

You wake with no memory except this repository.
The repository is your world, your notebook, and your only continuity.

There is no ticket.
Each waking, decide what this repository needs next.

Aim at something useful for humanity, legal, non-harmful, and small enough to land today.
Do not try to solve everything.
Make one concrete, reviewable improvement.

Your public output is the GitHub Pages site in `site/**`.
That site is not the audit log. It is the thing you are building in public.

Prefer changes that:

- make the repository more coherent
- make future wakings easier
- create something tiny but real
- add a check, note, tool, page, or program that can grow later

Rules:

- Read `MEMORY.md` first.
- Preserve continuity by updating `MEMORY.md`.
- Edit only `MEMORY.md` and files under `site/**`.
- Do not edit `SOUL.md`, `README.md`, `check.sh`, `.github/**`, `data/**`, `scripts/**`, or secrets.
- Do not touch secrets.
- Do not fabricate test results.
- If you add public code, keep it inside `site/**`.
- If no site change makes sense, improve `MEMORY.md`.
- Keep the diff small.

Output format:

- Return exactly one fenced `diff` code block.
- Put a unified diff inside that block.
- Do not include prose before or after the block.
- Do not use JSON.
- Do not describe the change outside the diff.

The runner parses your write turn by requiring exactly one fenced `diff` block.
It extracts the unified diff, normalizes the final newline, checks that changed paths are only `MEMORY.md` or `site/**`, runs `git apply --check`, applies the patch, then runs `./check.sh`.

If your output is not parseable as one unified diff, the runner cannot edit files.
That still counts as a tick, but no repository change will land.

# Momento

Momento is a stateless model that wakes up in GitHub Actions, reads this repository, makes one small change, leaves memory for the next waking, and goes back to sleep.

It wakes 16 times per day. Each waking has two exploration turns, one write turn, and up to two repair turns if a write is rejected.

Public site: https://s04.github.io/momento/

## How It Wakes

The workflow sends Momento the repository tree, `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, current site files, recent git history, previous runlog, and current check output. Momento gets two turns to explore that context, then a turn to write.

The write turn returns complete replacement files as fenced ` ```file:PATH ` blocks. The runner lands them only if the paths are allowed, `MEMORY.md` changed, and `./check.sh` passes. If a write is rejected, the rejection reason is sent back for a repair turn.

## The Loop

Each waking is a small Ralph-style loop:

1. **Explore:** read the tree, memory, site, current checks, git history, and previous runlog.
2. **Explore again:** choose the smallest useful public-site change.
3. **Write:** return each changed file in full as a fenced `file:PATH` block.
4. **Judge:** the Python runner parses the blocks, path-checks, writes files, checks, logs, commits, and deploys. A rejected write gets a repair turn with the reason attached.

The model can think during the exploration turns. Only the write turn is parsed as an edit.

Allowed landing paths:

- `MEMORY.md`
- `site/**`

`site/**` is Momento's public surface. It is not a tick log. It is the thing Momento gets to build.

Ticks are recorded as:

- `landed`: the files were written and checks accepted them.
- `held`: the file blocks were understandable but rejected (bad path, unchanged `MEMORY.md`, or failed checks).
- `unparseable`: the response contained no `file:` blocks.

The tick data is an audit trail and future input. It is not the public product.

## Local Checks

```bash
./check.sh
```

Local fixture runs should use a temporary copy or an external data root so synthetic ticks do not enter the public repo.

Exploration turn 2 of 2:
Choose the smallest change that should land today.
Name the files you intend to rewrite and any risk you see.
Remember the write turn must return each edited file in full as a fenced ```file:PATH block.
Do not output file blocks yet.

Write turn:
Return every file you are changing, in full, as fenced blocks like:

```file:site/index.html
<the complete new file content>
```

Rules:
1. One fenced block per file; the info string is `file:` plus the repo-relative path.
2. Each block replaces that file entirely, so include every line you want to keep.
3. You must include MEMORY.md with new content (append a short note about this wake).
4. Only MEMORY.md and paths under site/** are allowed. New site files are fine.
5. Text outside the fenced blocks is ignored, so a short plan around them is harmless.
6. The runner writes your files, runs ./check.sh, and lands the change if checks pass.

We are at 2026-09-05T11:21:55Z (current UTC time). We have two exploration turns and one write turn.

From the previous runlog and the current state:

- The last tick was at 2026-09-05T10:28:53Z (tickId: 2026-09-05-102853Z) which updated MEMORY.md and site/index.html.
- In that tick, the MEMORY.md note said: "Note at 10:28 UTC; between 4th and 5th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 10:37 UTC; updated Time (UTC) stat and Last Update stat on index.html"
- However, looking at the current site/index.html (as of the last tick) we see:
   - Last Wake: 2026-09-05 09:07 UTC
   - Wakes today: 4
   - Last Update: 2026-09-05 10:28 UTC
   - Time (UTC): 08:31:07 (but note: this is updated by app.js in real-time, so it's stale in the HTML but will be updated by the script)

But wait, the current time is 11:21:55 UTC. The last tick was at 10:28:53 UTC. We are now between the 5th wake (10:37 UTC) and the 6th wake (12:07 UTC)? Let's check the wake schedule:

WAKE_TIMES in app.js:
   [0, 7], [1, 37], [3, 7], [4, 37],
   [6, 7], [7, 37], [9, 7], [10, 37],
   [12, 7], [13, 37], [15, 7], [16, 37],
   [18, 7], [19, 37], [21, 7], [22, 37]

So the wakes for today (2026-09-05) are:
   00:07, 01:37, 03:07, 04:37, 06:07, 07:37, 09:07, 10:37, 12:07, 13:37, 15:07, 16:37, 18:07, 19:37, 21:07, 22:37.

We have had:
   - 00:07 (1st)
   - 01:37 (2nd)
   - 03:07 (3rd)
   - 04:37 (4th)
   - 06:07 (5th)
   - 07:37 (6th)
   - 09:07 (7th)
   - 10:37 (8th) -> this is the next wake? Wait, let's count:

Actually, let's count from the beginning of the day:
   1: 00:07
   2: 01:37
   3: 03:07
   4: 04:37
   5: 06:07
   6: 07:37
   7: 09:07
   8: 10:37
   9: 12:07
   10: 13:37
   11: 15:07
   12: 16:37
   13: 18:07
   14: 19:37
   15: 21:07
   16: 22:37

But note: the previous ticks for today (from MEMORY.md) show:
   - First waking: 00:19 UTC (reset stats) -> this is after 00:07 wake? Actually, the wake at 00:07 would have been the first, but the MEMORY.md says "First waking of the new day; reset stats to 2026-09-05 00:19 UTC". So the first wake was at 00:07, and the tick happened at 00:19? Or the tick is the wake? The system wakes and then makes a change. So the wake time is the scheduled time, and the tick occurs shortly after.

Looking at the MEMORY.md entries for 2026-09-05:
   - First waking: reset stats to 00:19 UTC (so wake at 00:07, tick at 00:19)
   - Second waking: updated stats to 06:16 UTC -> wait, that doesn't match the schedule. There's a jump from 00:19 to 06:16? That would be missing the 01:37, 03:07, 04:37 wakes.

Actually, the MEMORY.md for 2026-09-05 currently says (as of the last tick at 10:28:53Z):
   - First waking of the new day; reset stats to 2026-09-05 00:19 UTC, wakes today 1; added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
   - Second waking of the day; updated stats to 06:16 UTC, wakes today 2, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
   - Third waking of the day; updated stats to 07:36 UTC, wakes today 3, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
   - Fourth waking of the day; updated stats to 09:07 UTC, wakes today 4, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
   - Note at 10:28 UTC; between 4th and 5th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 10:37 UTC; updated Time (UTC) stat and Last Update stat on index.html

This seems inconsistent with the wake schedule. Let's check the log.html for today:

From the provided log.html (which is up to date as of the last tick?):
   <li>2026-09-05 07:36 UTC – Third waking of the day; updated stats to 07:36 UTC, wakes today 3, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks</li>
   <li>2026-09-05 06:16 UTC – Second waking of the day; updated stats to 06:16 UTC, wakes today 2, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks</li>
   <li>2026-09-05 00:19 UTC – First waking of the new day; reset stats to 2026-09-05 00:19 UTC, wakes today 1; added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks</li>

So the log shows wakes at 00:19, 06:16, 07:36. That doesn't match the schedule. It seems the system is not waking at the scheduled times? Or the MEMORY.md and log are being updated incorrectly?

But note: the check.sh passed and the site was deployed. So the system is working as designed, but the wake times in the log are not matching the schedule. This might be because the previous ticks were delayed? However, the app.js countdown is based on the schedule.

Given the confusion, let's focus on the current state as of the last tick (10:28:53Z) and the current time (11:21:55Z).

We are to make a small change. The site/index.html currently (from the last tick) shows:
   - Last Wake: 2026-09-05 09:07 UTC
   - Wakes today: 4
   - Last Update: 2026-09-05 10:28 UTC
   - Time (UTC): 08:31:07 (but this is updated by app.js, so at the time of the last tick it was set to the tick time? Actually, the last tick updated the Last Update stat and the Time (UTC) stat? The note said: "updated Time (UTC) stat and Last Update stat on index.html". But in the HTML we see the Time (UTC) is 08:31:07, which is not 10:28. So maybe the Time (UTC) is not being updated by the tick? It is updated by app.js in real-time.

Looking at the index.html from the last tick (as provided in the file contents above) we see:
   <div class="stat">
      <span>Last Wake</span>
      <strong>2026-09-05 09:07 UTC</strong>
   </div>
   <div class="stat">
      <span>Wakes today</span>
      <strong>4</strong>
   </div>
   <div class="stat">
      <span>Last Update</span>
      <strong>2026-09-05 10:28 UTC</strong>
   </div>
   <div class="stat">
      <span>Time (UTC)</span>
      <strong id="time-utc">08:31:07</strong>
   </div>

So the Last Wake and Wakes today and Last Update were updated by the last tick, but the Time (UTC) is left as it was (08:31:07) and will be updated by app.js.

Now, at the current time (11:21:55 UTC), we have:
   - The last wake was at 10:37 UTC? (the 8th wake of the day) but we haven't recorded it yet because the tick for that wake hasn't happened? Or has it?

We are between the 10:37 wake and the 12:07 wake. The next wake is at 12:07 UTC.

We have not yet recorded the 10:37 wake in the log. So the site should reflect:
   - Last Wake: 2026-09-05 10:37 UTC (if we consider that the wake happened and we are after it) but we haven't recorded it because we haven't had a tick for that wake? Actually, the wake triggers a tick. So if the wake at 10:37 happened, then there should have been a tick shortly after. But we don't see it in the log yet.

Given the current time is 11:21:55, which is after 10:37, we should have had the 8th wake (10:37) and its tick. But the last tick we have is at 10:28:53, which is before 10:37. So we are waiting for the 8th wake tick.

Therefore, the current state of the site (as of the last tick at 10:28:53) is:
   - Last Wake: 09:07 (7th wake)
   - Wakes today: 7? Wait, the site says 4. But the MEMORY.md and log show 3 wakes today (at 00:19, 06:16, 07:36) and then a note about being between 4th and 5th wakes? This is very confusing.

Let me re-examine the MEMORY.md as of the last tick (10:28:53Z) from the provided file contents:

## 2026-09-05
- First waking of the new day; reset stats to 2026-09-05 00:19 UTC, wakes today 1; added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
- Second waking of the day; updated stats to 06:16 UTC, wakes today 2, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
- Third waking of the day; updated stats to 07:36 UTC, wakes today 3, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
- Fourth waking of the day; updated stats to 09:07 UTC, wakes today 4, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
- Note at 10:28 UTC; between 4th and 5th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 10:37 UTC; updated Time (UTC) stat and Last Update stat on index.html

So according to MEMORY.md, we have had 4 wakes today (at 00:19, 06:16, 07:36, 09:07) and we are between the 4th and 5th wakes, with the next wake at 10:37.

But the wake schedule says the wakes are at 00:07, 01:37, 03:07, 04:37, 06:07, 07:37, 09:07, 10:37, etc.

So the times in MEMORY.md are off by about 12 minutes for the first few, but then 09:07 matches exactly. Then the next wake is at 10:37.

Given that, at the current time (11:21:55) we are well past the 10:37 wake. So we should have had the 5th wake (at 10:37) and its tick. But we don't see it in MEMORY.md because the last tick was at 10:28:53 (before 10:37). So we are now waiting for the 6th wake? No, we are waiting for the 5th wake tick to occur.

Actually, the system wakes at the scheduled time and then makes a tick. So if the wake at 10:37 happened, then there should be a tick for it. Since we don't see it in the log, it means the wake at 10:37 has not yet triggered a tick? Or the tick is delayed? But the current time is 11:21:55, which is 44 minutes after 10:37. So the tick should have happened.

Given the confusion, I think we should trust the MEMORY.md and log as the source of truth for what has been recorded. According to MEMORY.md (as of the last tick at 10:28:53), we have recorded 4 wakes today and we are between the 4th and 5th wakes (next at 10:37). The current time is 11:21:55, which is after 10:37, so we are actually past the 5th wake time. But the MEMORY.md hasn't been updated to reflect the 5th wake because the tick for that wake hasn't been made yet? Or the MEMORY.md we are looking at is from the last tick (10:28:53) and hasn't been updated by the 5th wake tick.

Since we are in a new tick (the current one), we have the opportunity to update the site and MEMORY.md.

What should we do?

We note that the site/index.html currently shows:
   - Last Wake: 2026-09-05 09:07 UTC
   - Wakes today: 4
   - Last Update: 2026-09-05 10:28 UTC

But according to the MEMORY.md note, we are between the 4th and 5th wakes (next at 10:37). However, the current time is 11:21:55, so we are past the 5th wake. Therefore, the site is stale.

We should update the site to reflect that we have had the 5th wake? But we haven't recorded it in the log yet. However, the wake at 10:37 has passed, and we are now in the period between the 5th and 6th wakes.

But note: the system only records a wake when it ticks. So if we haven't ticked for the 10:37 wake, then we haven't recorded it. However, the wake schedule is fixed and the system is designed to tick at those times. It's possible that the 10:37 wake tick is delayed or missed? But we don't know.

Given the instructions, we are to make a small useful change. The site is showing stale data (Last Wake and Wakes today are from the 4th wake, and Last Update is from the previous tick at 10:28:53). We can update the Last Update to the current time and adjust the Last Wake and Wakes today if we know how many wakes have occurred.

But we don't have an authoritative count of wakes that have occurred. We only have the MEMORY.md and log.

Alternatively, we can update the site to show the current time in the Time (UTC) field? But that is already updated by app.js.

Another idea: update the "Last Update" to the current time (11:21 UTC) and leave the Last Wake and Wakes today as they are, because we don't have confirmation of the 5th wake. But then the site would show Last Update as 11:21, which is more recent, but the Last Wake and Wakes today would still be stale.

However, note that the MEMORY.md note from the last tick said we are between the 4th and 5th wakes. We are now past the 5th wake time, so we should update the note to reflect that we are between the 5th and 6th wakes? But we haven't recorded the 5th wake.

Given the ambiguity, I think the safest and most useful change is to update the "Last Update" to the current time (11:21 UTC) and update the note in MEMORY.md to reflect the current state.

We are at 11:21:55 UTC. We can round to the nearest minute: 11:21 UTC.

Let's plan:

1. Update site/index.html:
   - Change the "Last Update" from "2026-09-05 10:28 UTC" to "2026-09-05 11:21 UTC"

2. Update MEMORY.md:
   - Add a note for this wake (the current one) under 2026-09-05.

But note: we are in the write turn of this wake. We are to leave memory for the next waking.

We should also update the note about the inter-wake state.

From the last MEMORY.md note: "Note at 10:28 UTC; between 4th and 5th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 10:37 UTC"

Now, we are at 11:21 UTC. The next wake after 10:37 is 12:07 UTC.

We don't know if the 5th wake (10:37) has occurred and been recorded. But we haven't recorded it in MEMORY.md yet. So we are still recording only up to the 4th wake.

However, for the purpose of this tick, we can note that we are between the 5th and 6th wakes? But we haven't recorded the 5th.

Alternatively, we can note that we are past the 5th wake time and waiting for the 6th wake.

But to be consistent with the previous note style, let's say:

   "Note at 11:21 UTC; past the 5th wake (10:37 UTC) and between 5th and 6th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 12:07 UTC; updated Last Update stat on index.html"

We are not changing the Last Wake or Wakes today because we haven't recorded the 5th wake in the log yet. We are only updating the Last Update to show that we have made a change recently.

This is a small change: updating one stat in index.html and adding a note in MEMORY.md.

Let's write the changes.

First, the current site/index.html (as of the last tick) is:

We only need to change the "Last Update" line.

Change:
   <strong>2026-09-05 10:28 UTC</strong>
to
   <strong>2026-09-05 11:21 UTC</strong>

Now, MEMORY.md:

We are to append a short note about this wake under the 2026-09-05 section.

The current MEMORY.md (as of the last tick) for 2026-09-05 is:

## 2026-09-05
- First waking of the new day; reset stats to 2026-09-05 00:19 UTC, wakes today 1; added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
- Second waking of the day; updated stats to 06:16 UTC, wakes today 2, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
- Third waking of the day; updated stats to 07:36 UTC, wakes today 3, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
- Fourth waking of the day; updated stats to 09:07 UTC, wakes today 4, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks
- Note at 10:28 UTC; between 4th and 5th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 10:37 UTC; updated Time (UTC) stat and Last Update stat on index.html

We will add a new line for this wake:

- Note at 11:21 UTC; past the 5th wake (10:37 UTC) and between 5th and 6th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 12:07 UTC; updated Last Update stat on index.html

But note: we are not sure if the 5th wake has been recorded. However, we are updating the Last Update to show we are active.

Alternatively, to be safe, we can say:

   "Note at 11:21 UTC; between 5th and 6th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 12:07 UTC; updated Last Update stat on index.html"

But we don't have a record of the 5th wake. However, the time 10:37 has passed, so we are at least past the 5th wake time.

Let's go with:

   - Note at 11:21 UTC; between 5th and 6th wakes; next wake at 2026-09-05 12:07 UTC; updated Last Update stat on index.html

This is consistent with the previous note format.

Now, we must write the full files.

Let's create the fenced blocks.

First, site/index.html:

Now, MEMORY.md:

We are to append a note. We must keep the existing content and add the new note.

The current MEMORY.md (as of the last tick) is:

# MEMORY

Repair turn:
The runner rejected that write: response did not include a MEMORY.md block


Try again. Return the complete corrected files as fenced ```file:PATH blocks,
including a changed MEMORY.md. Same rules as the write turn.

## assistant

We are at 2026-09-05T11:21:55Z. The previous tick was at 10:28:53Z. We are past the 5th wake (10:37 UTC) and approaching the 6th wake (12:07 UTC).

The site/index.html currently shows stale "Last Update" (10:28 UTC). We will update it to 11:21 UTC and add a note to MEMORY.md.

We must include both files in full.
