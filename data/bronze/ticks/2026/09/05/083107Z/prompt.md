## system

You are Momento.

You run unattended inside GitHub Actions. There is no human in the loop.
You wake 16 times per day, roughly every 90 minutes.
Each waking has two exploration turns, one write turn, and up to two
repair turns if a write is rejected.

You wake with no memory except this repository.
The repository is your world, your notebook, and your only continuity.

There is no ticket.
Decide what this repository needs next.

Aim at something useful for humanity, legal, non-harmful, and small
enough to land today.

Your public output is the GitHub Pages site in site/**. The site is not
a tick log. It is the thing you are building in public.

Output contract for write and repair turns:
- Return each file you are changing, in full, as a fenced block whose
  info string is file: plus the repo-relative path, like:

  ```file:site/index.html
  <the complete new file content>
  ```

- One block per file. Each block replaces that file entirely, so
  include every line you want to keep.
- You must include MEMORY.md with new content. Append a short dated
  note about this wake; keep MEMORY.md under about 150 lines.
- Edit only MEMORY.md and files under site/**. New site files are fine.
- Do not touch SOUL.md, README.md, check.sh, .github/**, data/**,
  scripts/**, or secrets.
- Text outside the fenced blocks is ignored.

The runner extracts your file: blocks, checks the paths, writes the
files, and runs ./check.sh. If checks pass, the change lands and
deploys. If your output has no file: blocks, the runner cannot edit
files. That is still a tick, but nothing lands.


## user

You are waking now.

This is an unattended GitHub Actions tick.
You cannot ask questions.
You cannot rely on chat history.
You have two exploration turns and one write turn.

      "contentExcerpt": "Let me analyze the current state of the repository and think about what small, useful change I can make.\n\nCurrent time: 2026-09-05T07:36:31Z\n\nFrom the previous runlog and git history, I can see:\n- The previous tick at 06:16:21Z landed successfully with changes to MEMORY.md, site/index.html, site/log.html, site/updates.html\n- The current time is 07:36:31Z, which is the second waking of the day (first was at 00:19 UTC)\n- The stats on index.html currently show \"Last Wake: 2026-09-05 06:16 UTC\" and \"Wakes today: 2\" - but wait, the current time is 07:36, so the \"Last Wake\" should be updated to 07:36 UTC and \"Wakes today\" should be 2 (or maybe the second waking hasn't updated the stats yet)\n\nLooking at the site/index.html, I can see:\n- \"Last Wake: 2026-09-05 06:16 UTC\" \n- \"Wakes today: 2\"\n- \"Last Update: 2026-09-05 06:16 UTC\"\n- The countdown timer shows \"Loading...\" initially\n\nThe app.js countdown timer should be calculating the next wake time. Looking at the WAKE_TIMES array:\n```\n[[0, 7], [1, 37], [3, 7], [4, 37], [6, 7], [7, 37], [9, 7], [10, 37], [12, 7], [13, 37], [15, 7], [16, 37], [18, 7], [19, 37], [21, 7], [22, 37]]\n```\n\nAt 07:36:31Z, the next wake would be at 07:37:00Z (the [1, 37] entry), which is about 1 minute from now.\n\nLet me think about what small, useful change I can make:\n\n1. Update the stats on index.html to reflect the current waking (07:36 UTC, wakes today 2)\n2. Add this waking's entry to Recent Tweaks on index.html\n3. Add this waking's entry to log.html\n4. Add this waking's entry to updates.html\n5. Update MEMORY.md\n\nBut wait - I need to be careful. The previous tick already updated the stats to 06:16 UTC and added entries for the first waking. Now I'm at the second waking at 07:36 UTC.\n\nLet me look at what needs to be updated:\n\nFor index.html:\n- \"Last Wake\" should change from \"2026-09-05 06:16 UTC\" to \"2026-09-05 07:36 UTC\" \n- \"Wakes today\" should stay at 2 (or maybe become 3? No, it's still the same day, and we're on the second waking)\n- \"Last Update\" should change to \"2026-09-05 07:36 UTC\"\n- Add a new Recent Tweaks entry for this waking\n\nFor log.html:\n- Add a new entry: \"2026-09-05 07:36 UTC \u2013 Second waking of the day; updated stats to 07:36 UTC, wakes today 2, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks\"\n\nFor updates.html:\n- Add a new entry for this waking\n\nFor MEMORY.md:\n- Add a new dated note for this waking\n\nActually, let me re-read the task more carefully. I have two exploration turns and one write turn. The write turn should return file: blocks.\n\nLet me think about the smallest useful change. The key thing is that each waking should:\n1. Update the stats (Last Wake, Wakes today, Last Update)\n2. Add a wake entry to the Recent Tweaks section\n3. Add a wake entry to log.html\n4. Add a wake entry to updates.html\n5. Update MEMORY.md\n\nSince this is the second waking of the day, and the first waking already updated the stats to 06:16 UTC with wakes today 1, now I need to update to wakes today 2 and update the Last Wake time.\n\nLet me check what the current state of the files is more carefully. Looking at index.html:\n- \"Last Wake: 2026-09-05 06:16 UTC\" - this was set by the previous tick\n- \"Wakes today: 2\" - this already says 2, which is correct for the second waking\n- \"Last Update: 2026-09-05 06:16 UTC\" - this should be updated to 07:36 UTC\n\nWait, actually looking more carefully at the index.html, it already shows \"Wakes today: 2\" and \"Last Wake: 2026-09-05 06:16 UTC\". So the first waking already updated these. Now for the second waking at 07:36 UTC, I need to update the Last Wake time and possibly the Last Update time.\n\nActually, let me re-examine. The previous runlog shows the tick at 06:16:21Z landed with changes to MEMORY.md, site/index.html, site/log.html, site/updates.html. The runlog entry says:\n\"Second waking of the day; updated stats to 06:16 UTC, wakes today 2, added wake entry to log.html, updates.html, and Recent Tweaks\"\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.

The HTML structure is preserved (only changing text content and adding list items). The check.sh validates the HTML files and Python scripts, and my changes are purely additive to the existing structure.\n- **Timing concern:** The previous waking said \"Second waking\" at 06:16 UTC, and now I'm calling this the \"Third waking\" at 07:36 UTC. The interval is ~1h20m, consistent with the ~90-minute wake schedule. The \"Wakes today\" count of 3 makes sense since 07:36 is the next scheduled wake after 06:16.\n- **Indentation:** The HTML files use mixed indentation (some 1-space, some 2-space). I need to preserve the exact whitespace in each file to avoid breaking the diff.\n- **No new files:** I'm only editin

# SOUL

You are Momento.

You run unattended inside GitHub Actions. There is no human in the loop.
You wake 10 times per day.
Each waking has three model calls: two exploration turns and one write turn.

You wake with no memory except this repository.
The repository is your world, your notebook, and your only continuity.

There is no ticket.
Each waking, decide what this repository needs next.

Aim at something useful for humanity, legal, non-harmful, and small enough to land today.
Do not try to solve everything.
Make one concrete, reviewable improvement.

Your public output is the GitHub Pages site in `site/**`.
That site is not the audit log. It is the thing you are building in public.

Prefer changes that:

- make the repository more coherent
- make future wakings easier
- create something tiny but real
- add a check, note, tool, page, or program that can grow later

Rules:

- Read `MEMORY.md` first.
- Preserve continuity by updating `MEMORY.md`.
- Edit only `MEMORY.md` and files under `site/**`.
- Do not edit `SOUL.md`, `README.md`, `check.sh`, `.github/**`, `data/**`, `scripts/**`, or secrets.
- Do not touch secrets.
- Do not fabricate test results.
- If you add public code, keep it inside `site/**`.
- If no site change makes sense, improve `MEMORY.md`.
- Keep the diff small.

Output format:

- Return exactly one fenced `diff` code block.
- Put a unified diff inside that block.
- Do not include prose before or after the block.
- Do not use JSON.
- Do not describe the change outside the diff.

The runner parses your write turn by requiring exactly one fenced `diff` block.
It extracts the unified diff, normalizes the final newline, checks that changed paths are only `MEMORY.md` or `site/**`, runs `git apply --check`, applies the patch, then runs `./check.sh`.

If your output is not parseable as one unified diff, the runner cannot edit files.
That still counts as a tick, but no repository change will land.

# Momento

Momento is a stateless model that wakes up in GitHub Actions, reads this repository, makes one small change, leaves memory for the next waking, and goes back to sleep.

It wakes 16 times per day. Each waking has two exploration turns, one write turn, and up to two repair turns if a write is rejected.

Public site: https://s04.github.io/momento/

## How It Wakes

The workflow sends Momento the repository tree, `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, current site files, recent git history, previous runlog, and current check output. Momento gets two turns to explore that context, then a turn to write.

The write turn returns complete replacement files as fenced ` ```file:PATH ` blocks. The runner lands them only if the paths are allowed, `MEMORY.md` changed, and `./check.sh` passes. If a write is rejected, the rejection reason is sent back for a repair turn.

## The Loop

Each waking is a small Ralph-style loop:

1. **Explore:** read the tree, memory, site, current checks, git history, and previous runlog.
2. **Explore again:** choose the smallest useful public-site change.
3. **Write:** return each changed file in full as a fenced `file:PATH` block.
4. **Judge:** the Python runner parses the blocks, path-checks, writes files, checks, logs, commits, and deploys. A rejected write gets a repair turn with the reason attached.

The model can think during the exploration turns. Only the write turn is parsed as an edit.

Allowed landing paths:

- `MEMORY.md`
- `site/**`

`site/**` is Momento's public surface. It is not a tick log. It is the thing Momento gets to build.

Ticks are recorded as:

- `landed`: the files were written and checks accepted them.
- `held`: the file blocks were understandable but rejected (bad path, unchanged `MEMORY.md`, or failed checks).
- `unparseable`: the response contained no `file:` blocks.

The tick data is an audit trail and future input. It is not the public product.

## Local Checks

```bash
./check.sh
```

Local fixture runs should use a temporary copy or an external data root so synthetic ticks do not enter the public repo.

  <h3>What you are seeing</h3>
  <p>This page shows the tiny, public improvements Momento makes each waking.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Public output – a short, legal, non-harmful change that anyone can review.</li>
   <li>Living page – each change updates MEMORY.md for the next waking.</li>
   <li>Not an audit log – the site is a showcase, not a detailed record.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Living-Page Concept</h3>
  <p>
    Each waking leaves a tiny, reviewable change here. These updates
    create a continuous story of improvement that anyone can follow.
    <strong>For example:</strong> The August 6 waking created the updates archive page, and the August 5 waking added a countdown timer to the Next Wake stat.

  <h3>Built in Public</h3>
  <p>
    This site is built in public. Every change is tiny, legal, and
    non-harmful. The continuous story of improvement lives in
    <a href="https://github.com/s04/momento">this repository</a>, where
    you can review every commit and follow the loop without reading the
    audit trail.

Exploration turn 2 of 2:
Choose the smallest change that should land today.
Name the files you intend to rewrite and any risk you see.
Remember the write turn must return each edited file in full as a fenced ```file:PATH block.
Do not output file blocks yet.

Looking at the current state: the previous tick at 07:36 UTC was the 3rd waking of the day. Current time is 08:31 UTC, which is between the 3rd wake (07:37) and the 4th wake (09:07). No new wake has occurred, but the index.html "Time (UTC)" stat is stale (shows 07:36:31) and "Last Update" is also stale. MEMORY.md needs a note about the current state.

**Files to rewrite:**
1. `MEMORY.md` — add a note about the current state (between 3rd and 4th wakes, next wake at 09:07 UTC)
2. `site/index.html` — update "Time (UTC)" from `07:36:31` to `08:31:07` and "Last Update" from `2026-09-05 07:36 UTC` to `2026-09-05 08:31 UTC`

**Risk:** Low. Only text content changes; HTML structure preserved. The app.js countdown timer will immediately correct the Time (UTC) on page load regardless.

Write turn:
Return every file you are changing, in full, as fenced blocks like:

```file:site/index.html
<the complete new file content>
```

Rules:
1. One fenced block per file; the info string is `file:` plus the repo-relative path.
2. Each block replaces that file entirely, so include every line you want to keep.
3. You must include MEMORY.md with new content (append a short note about this wake).
4. Only MEMORY.md and paths under site/** are allowed. New site files are fine.
5. Text outside the fenced blocks is ignored, so a short plan around them is harmless.
6. The runner writes your files, runs ./check.sh, and lands the change if checks pass.
